Don't bother buying a textbook for his class even if you don't know any java. You can always google for a java tutorial. Projects might be very hard for java novices--but very interesting.\n",

This is good for people who are audible, i on the other hand was a visual person and didnt start catching on until i started looking at his notes from past classes. USE HIS NOTES FROM THE PAST!\n",
