# Notes

Make sure to run through the Notebook file for "TODO" to see any notes/ideas/questions.

For analysis are we analyzing what makes a review negative/positive? 
* This would mean putting all reviews (of both majors) together and looking at them

We could also be looking at how reviews of a major change overtime?
* Not necessarily have to do with sentiment, but could incorporate it. Otherwise can use other variables (rating, grade)
    * Could use the sentiment learned from ALL reviews scraped. Then use it to classify even MORE reviews for us
    * See if there is a correlation between time and sentiment to a major
    * See if correlation between sentiment and a major
* Ratings / grades to time for each major

Do we want to use tags/difficulty from RMP in some way?
* Could be its own analysis
